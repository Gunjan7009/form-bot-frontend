# For building form flow for the chatbot

This template provides a way to use form bot for building form.

On the dashboard we are creating folders and inside that we are creating typebots/forms when we click on that particular typebot/form it will head to formbuilding part where on the left side there
are two categories BUbbles and Inputs elements.

# Bubbles elemenets

These are the elements when added as it will the messages send by bot for the user where we can edit the label to classify which type of message we are sending from bot and what type of message user will send to the bot

# Inputs elements 
These are the elements when added as in it label of that particular element will be edited to send the customised message to the user to what type of input going to be filled and then the particular user will send the details of theirs to the bot and delete button will remove the elements from the flow 

share will copy the link to clipboard to visit the bot next time
